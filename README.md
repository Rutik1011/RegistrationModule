## Introduction

This module provides a basic user registration functionality. Users can fill out a registration form, and their information is stored in the MySQL database. This project demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot, Hibernate, JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building a complete web application.

## Features

-   User registration form with HTML structure, styled with CSS.
-   Data persistence to MySQL database using Hibernate.
-   Server-side processing with Spring Boot.
-   Displays a success message upon successful registration.

## Technologies Used

-   **Spring Boot:** Provides the foundation for the application and simplifies dependency management.
-   **Hibernate:** ORM framework for database interaction.
-   **MySQL:** Relational database for storing user information.
-   **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** Used for creating dynamic web pages.
-   **HTML:** Defines the structure and content of the web pages.
-   **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements for a visually appealing user interface.
-   **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to the web pages.
-   **Maven:** Build tool for managing project dependencies and building the application.
-   **Eclipse:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
